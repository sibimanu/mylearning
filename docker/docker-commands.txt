Are you behind a proxy server?

Proxy servers can block connections to your web app once itâ€™s up and running. If you are behind a proxy server, add the following lines to your Dockerfile, using the ENV command to specify the host and port for your proxy servers:

# Set proxy server, replace host:port with values for your servers
ENV http_proxy host:port
ENV https_proxy host:port
